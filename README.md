## 📌 What is Smart Aid AI?

Smart Aid AI helps people in need find:
- 🍽️ **Food Banks** — Free meals, langar, ration packages
- 🏥 **Clinics** — Free or low-cost medical care
- 🤝 **NGOs** — Welfare organizations across Pakistan

Just type what you need in simple English — the AI finds the best match!

## 🧠 How it Works (RAG)

```
User Query → Sentence Transformers → FAISS Search → Best Results
```

- Uses **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- **Semantic search** — understands meaning, not just keywords
- Works with Urdu-style English too (e.g. "mujhe khana chahiye")
